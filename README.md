IT'S AN ANT SIMULATOR!!!!!

Well, sorta. Anyway, it's great to watch and can teach you about things like:

LOOPING!!!

It doesn't have anything much to do with ants but it is good fun to watch and a great way to waste time

To change the number of ants you have to got into the coding.

Also, i goes too fast if you have less than about 50 ants, and too slow if you use sleep.
